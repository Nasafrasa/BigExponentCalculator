# BigExponentCalculator
A Java program that can calculate ANY exponent!

## What is this?
This is a simple java program that can calculate any number that you trow at it, as long as you rcomputer can handle it! This is my first code that I've created and releasing to to public, I made it because I couldn't find any calculators online that could calculator a number I had in mind. So I made this! It's simple, not too much, and as long as you have Java installed and know how to run .java programs this should be really easy to use.

## How to use
1. Download the zip and and put the folder on your desktop or anywhere you want.
2. Open your Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and navigate to the **BigExponentCalculator** folder.
3. Run the command ```javac BEC.java``` in your terminal window to complie the code.
4. Run the command ```java BEC``` in your terminal window to run the program.
5. Enter the name of the text file you want to make.
6. Enter the base of your number.
7. Enter the exponent of your number.
8. The text file should appear in the **BigExponentCalculator** folder after the terminal outputs: ```File successfully created: filename.txt```.
