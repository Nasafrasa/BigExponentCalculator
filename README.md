# BigExponentCalculator
A Java program that can calculate ANY exponent!

## What is this?
This is a simple java program that can calculate any number that you trow at it, as long as you rcomputer can handle it! This is my first code that I've created and releasing to to public, I made it because I couldn't find any calculators online that could calculator a number I had in mind. So I made this! It's simple, not too much, and as long as you have Java installed and know how to run .java programs this should be really easy to use.
